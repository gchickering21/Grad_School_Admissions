    "I focused on creating and comparing a logistic regression model, a support vector machine model, and a decision tree model on my dataset. These three models then got combined to form one ensemble method, and the results of these four models were compared. The dataset I chose to work with was on predicting the likelihood of someone getting admitted to grad school, based on factors such as GRE Score, Univerisity Rating,LOR, etc. Since my target variable, AdmitPercentage, was not a binary classifier, I had to create a new variable, LikelihoodAdmit, that was a binary classifier. I said someone had a high chance of grad school if their LikelihoodAdmit was greater than 0.7. This allowed the classes to be split roughly 50%-50% for each of the groups. I then used this column as my target variable to make predictions. For these set of models, I let the models be trained on all the feature variables that were in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also performed the grid search algorithm on both my logistic regression and support vector mahcine pipelines in order to find the best hyperparameters for the model. After creating and fitting the models on the training set using 10 fold cross validation, I end up comparing accuracy scores on the testing sets of the four models to see which one performs best for the dataset. This should allow me to pick the model that will best predict whether or not someone has a good chance of getting admitted to a graduate school."

    "From running a 10 fold cross validation on each of the different models, we can see that the three models do an extremely good job for all four of the different models. For the SVM, Decision Tree, and the Ensemble Majority Voting methods, we can see that the accuracy is 100% with 0 standard deviation. For the Logistic Regression model we can that this one only performs marginally worse with an accuracy of 0.99 and a std deviation of 0.011. This means that each of the four models does an extremely good job on fitting the training dataset. One of the potential worries with this is that the model may have high variance and could have an over-fitting issue but we can now test our models and see how they do on the testing set to see if this ends up being true."

    "For all four of the models, we can see that each one of them 100% perfectly classified the 150 examples in the testing data set. This means that for this dataset, either of the four models would be a great model to use. While I was wary that the models overfit the training data, we can see that the high accuracy scores still held up when we fitted them to the testing data. While this may seem suprising to have this high of an accuracy score, I think this occurred based on how I split up the dataset to begin with. If I were to change the highchance of admit to above say 80% or even 90% I believe the dataset might not have done as good of a job predicting the testing set. What these models do tell us though is that when we use all the different factor variables that are available in the dataset, that we can create a very good model that accruately predicts if someone has a high likelhood of getting into graduate school or not. Overall each of these models do a great job of predicting admit likelihood though."
