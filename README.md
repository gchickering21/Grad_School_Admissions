# Using Ensemble Methods to Predict Grad School Admission

For this project I focused on comparing multiple different machine learning algorithms to see which model would do the best job of predicting of who would get inot graduate school. The models I chose to compare were a logistic regression model, a support vector machine model, and a decision tree model on my dataset. These three models then got combined to form one ensemble method, and the results of these four models were compared.

To view how this comparison was done see [Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/gchickering21/Grad_School_Admissions/blob/main/Analysis.ipynb)
